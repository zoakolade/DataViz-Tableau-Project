# Final-Project-Tableau
Airbnb is a platform that allows homeowners to put up their properties for short, medium and long stays while getting some extra income. It was founded in August 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk. It began as a way for them to rent out air mattresses in their apartment to attendees of a design conference in San Francisco. My analysis covers Airbnb in New York City which I will be drilling down on the data available.

## Project/Goals
The goal of the project is to review the various Neighborhood, Host, Room Type, Price e.t.c in New York City with the use of various visual representations.


## Process
I connect to Data Source after which I was able to review the data and perform some data cleaning then went ahead to create worksheets that could provide insights to the business and also created a dashboard.
Concluded by formatting and customization of all the sheets to fit into the dashboard, then I published and share to be able to save to pdf and twbx.

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)
The dataset I worked with is the Airbnb.xlsx which provided information regarding the business in New York City. Using the various visualization below I was able to discover some information:

Bar Chart (Host Bookings by Month and Neighbourhood Group - Room Type):
This chart helps to show the month with the highest bookings by all the neighborhoods. The graph reveals that July records the highest number of bookings in the year. The bookings looks pretty stable month-on-month but higher bookings is experienced in July, this could be as a result of the summer season when there are lots of guest on vacation which leads to more bookings.

Bar Chart (Top 10 Hosts by Total Reviews):
This bar graph shows the top 10 hosts with their host id and the neighborhood they are located. It gives a quick insight on their average price and the number of reviews they have. On the business side it shows that Airbnb is striving more in Manhattan and for investors looking to invest by location they can sort for properties there

Tree-map (Average Price by Neighbourhood):
This tree-map shows the size composition of the neighborhoods and their average price. We can toggle around the various room types. However, it Visualizes that Manhattan has the highest average price, followed by Staten Island and Bronx with the lowest average prices.

Pie Chart (Neighbourhoods by Property Type):
The pie chart shows the neighborhoods by property type Illustrates that Manhattan covers over 50% of the neighborhoods with all the type being considered. This means that the business is striving more in Manhattan irrespective of the property type.

Highlight Table (Average Reviews Score by Room Type and Neighbourhood):
This highlight table tries to depict the various room types and the average reviews gotten by them. It however, shows that an entire home has more reviews than a private room or shared room. This shows that guest prefers spaces without other people interference.

Highlights (Total Hosts, Total Neighbourhoods, Average Reviews per Month, Total Reviews):
Utilized to emphasize key figures such as the total number of hosts, neighbourhoods in New York City, average reviews per month, and total reviews.
    
## Challenges 
Obtaining precise longitude and latitude coordinates from the available data is crucial in order to effectively generate geographical maps that accurately represent geographic locations and their spatial relationships.

## Future Goals
1. Drill further down into Airbnb API to get API details so as to get the longitude and latitude of the various locations. This will help in the creation of geographical maps.
2. Analyse the data of another location like a province in Canada to compare what the business looks like in both countries.
